# websystem
Websystem is a web-based operating system taking advantage of WebAssembly, WebWorkers, IndexedDB, and other emerging web technologies.

  - Fully Customizable File System
  - Rapid and Easy App Development
  - Integrated IDE and Terminal Shell
  - Files are Saved Locally Through IndexedDB/WebSQL (localForage)

### Tech
Websystem uses WebWorkers to enable multithreading and gets the best performance out of the browser. WebAssembly is used to speed up calculations and improve user experience.

##### Installation
All that is needed to install is to download and run the `index.html` file! 
Note: Some browsers may require a server to be run for Websystem to have all features.

### Libraries
WebSystem currently uses the localForage library for desktop storage, however eventually a custom library for WebSystem will be written.

### Terminal
The terminal uses bash-like syntax and allows for complete control over the operating system. `not-implemented`
