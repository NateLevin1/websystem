# Contributing to WebSystem
WebsSystem is improved by the community's input! Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/UltimatePro-Grammer/websystem/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue!
#### Contributing an app
To contribute an app, open an issue with the app's name, description, tags, and source code.

## Contribute code using [pull requests](https://github.com/UltimatePro-Grammer/websystem/pulls)
We use GitHub PRs to add, change, and remove code.
#### Good first PRs
Good pull requests to create if you are interested in contributing are:
- Fixing spelling mistakes
- Removing commented out code
- Improving code style

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. *Anyone* who has WebSystem running locally should be able to reproduce the bug with sample code
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) that covers the project.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style If Possible
* Tabs or 2 spaces for indentation
