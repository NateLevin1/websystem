# websystem
Websystem is a web-based operating system taking advantage of WebAssembly, WebWorkers, and other emerging web technologies.

  - Fully Customizable File System
  - Rapid and Easy App Development
  - Integrated IDE and Shell
  - Files are Saved Locally Through LocalStorage

### Tech
Websystem uses WebWorkers to enable multithreading and gets the best performance out of the browser. WebAssembly is used to speed up calculations and improve user experience.

Additionally, Websystem depends on no outside libraries meaning the page will load in a snap.

##### Installation
All that is needed to install is to download and run the `index.html` file! 
Note: Some browsers may require a server to be run for Websystem to have all features.

### Terminal
The terminal uses bash-like syntax and allows for complete control over the operating system. `not-implemented`
